# EfficientNet (PyTorch)

My implementation of [__Efficient-Net__](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) in `nn.Sequence` manner (i.e. without `nn.Module`) for feature extraction layers. This approach is more convinient for working with __CAM (Class Activation Mapping)__ for example.

__TODO__:
- upload weight for all EfficientNet scales
- add use case how to train model on own data
- add case how to extract features
